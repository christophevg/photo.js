photo.js is a small Javascript library that activates basic HTML and turns it
into a dynamic photo viewer widget. By registering callbacks, any external
data-source or other visual components can be integrated in a loosely coupled
way.

This way, photo.js doesn't add any structural HTML to the document and doesn't
impose any visual design. It merely updates a set of tags according to a basic
convention: just identify a few elements in your HTML and photo.js will use
these to render any month.

The examples/ directory contains examples that integrate photo.js with Google
Photos (Picasaweb).
